## Environmenthttps://github.com/RaindragonD/FACTR.git
```bash
conda env create -f env.yaml
conda activate factr
```
We make use of the pretrained weights for visual encoders from [data4robotics](https://github.com/SudeepDasari/data4robotics) project. Download the pretrained features as follows:
```bash
bash scripts/download_features.sh
```
## Data Collection and Processing
We provide instructions and sample data collection scripts in ROS2 at [factr_teleop](https://github.com/RaindragonD/factr_teleop/). You might need your custom nodes for robots and sensors to run the system. In our case, the collected data is saved in following format:
### Data Structure
Each trajectory is saved as a separate pickle file. Each pickle file contains a dictionary with the following structure:
```
trajectory.pkl
├── "data" : dict
│   ├── "topic_name_1" : list[data_points]
│   ├── "topic_name_2" : list[data_points]
│   └── ...
└── "timestamps" : dict
    ├── "topic_name_1" : list[timestamps]
    ├── "topic_name_2" : list[timestamps]
    └── ...
```
### Key Components:

- **data**: A dictionary where:
  - Keys are the data source names (ROS topic names in our implementation)
  - Values are lists containing the actual data points (low-dimensional states or images)

- **timestamps**: A dictionary where:
  - Keys are the same data source names as in the "data" dictionary
  - Values are lists containing the timestamps when each corresponding data point was recorded

*Note*: Different data sources may log at different frequencies, resulting in varying list lengths across data sources. The timestamps are crucial for properly aligning and post-processing the data.
While ROS provides synchronization APIs, we chose to record raw timestamps and perform post-processing to allow for greater flexibility in data analysis and alignment.
```python
# Example of a trajectory structure
{
    "data": {
        "/camera/rgb/image_raw": [image1, image2, ...],
        "/joint_states": [state1, state2, ...],
        "/robot/end_effector_pose": [pose1, pose2, ...]
    },
    "timestamps": {
        "/camera/rgb/image_raw": [1615420323.45, 1615420323.55, ...],
        "/joint_states": [1615420323.40, 1615420323.50, ...],
        "/robot/end_effector_pose": [1615420323.42, 1615420323.52, ...]
    }
}
```
### Data Processing
If the data is in the aforementioned format, we provide sample scripts to process data to create data in [robobuf](https://github.com/AGI-Labs/robobuf) format that our learning pipeline takes in.
```bash
python process_data/process_data.py
```
Please checkout the [config file](process_data/cfg/default.yaml) for details about configurations.Besides the robobuf (a pickle file), the data processing file also produces a *rollout_config.yaml*, which specifies necessary information--such as normalization and data dimensions--to rollout the policy in the realworld.


## Training

To train a BC policy, the following script gives an example of the script and command-line arguments. The default parameters are set in [cfg/train_bc.yaml]

```bash
bash scripts/train_bc.sh
```
There are several important configs to set up to train your own policy:
- A task configuration file under [cfg/task](cfg/task) which specifies the observation dimensions, action dimensions, and camera indices for visual inputs
- The path to the dataset (a pickle file in the robobuf format)
- The curriculum parameteters

## Policy Rollout
We provide instructions and sample policy rollout scripts in ROS2 at [factr_teleop](https://github.com/RaindragonD/factr_teleop/). Again, you might need your custom nodes for robots and sensors to run the system.
